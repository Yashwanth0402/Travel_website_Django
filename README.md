#This is a simple website for booking tours. This website is exclusive to a certain trip operator. Tours can be scheduled online by users.

For the ongoing project: 
1. The data from the detailed_desc and destionation tables, which are available in my Travello repository in.sql format, must be added to the table for the active project.
2. I've included points in settings.py on OTP-related topics.
3.Use Trip_same_id = 1 as the first entry in the passenger detail; the remainder value can be whatever.
